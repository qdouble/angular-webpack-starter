# Complete starter seed project for Angular 2

> Featuring Material Design 2, Webpack 2 (and Webpack DLL plugin for faster dev builds), HMR (Hot Module Replacement), @ngrx for state management and optional server-side rendering with Universal.

## Project Goals

* The main goal is to provide an environment where you can have great dev tools and create a production application without worrying about adding a bunch of stuff yourself.
* The goal of your design should be so that you can easily copy and paste your app folder and your constants file into to a new update of this project and have it still work. Use constants and have proper separation to make upgrades easy. If you have any suggestions on areas where this starter can be designed to make updates more easy, file an issue.

## Basic scripts

Use `npm start` for dev server. Default dev port is `3000`.

Use `npm run start:hmr` to run dev server in HMR mode.

Use `npm run build` for production build.

Use `npm run server:prod` for production server and production watch. Default production port is `8088`.

Use `npm run universal` to run production build in Universal. To run and build universal in AOT mode, use
`npm run universal:aot`. Default universal port is `8000`.

Default ports and option to use proxy backend for dev server can be changed in `constants.js` file.

To create AOT version, run `npm run compile`. This will compile and build script.
Then you can use `npm run prodserver` to see to serve files.
Do not use build:aot directly unless you have already compiled.
Use `npm run compile` instead, it compiles and builds:aot

The scripts are set to compile css next to scss because ngc compiler does not support Sass.
To compile scss, use `npm run sass`, but many of the scripts will either build or watch scss files.

### Store Log Monitor / Store Logger

In development mode, the store log monitor appears on the right hand of your screen. This allows
you to view your stored state and manipulate your state history. By default, the monitor is NOT imported
when you are in production mode. State history is also not saved in production mode.

There is also an option to use store-logger which outputs to the console instead of your application view.
To set your development mode store logging preference, go to the constant.js file and edit the `STORE_DEV_TOOLS` constant.
Available options are `monitor | logger | both | none`

### HMR (Hot Module Replacement)

HMR mode allows you to update a particular module without reloading the entire application.
The current state of your app is also stored in @ngrx/store allowing you to make updates to your
code without losing your currently stored state.

### AOT  Don'ts

The following are some things that will make AOT compile fail.

- Don’t use require statements for your templates or styles, use styleUrls and templateUrls, the angular2-template-loader plugin will change it to require at build time.
- Don’t use default exports.
- Don’t use form.controls.controlName, use form.get(‘controlName’)
- Don’t use control.errors?.someError, use control.hasError(‘someError’)
- Don’t use functions in your providers, routes or declarations, export a function and then reference that function name
- Inputs, Outputs, View or Content Child(ren), Hostbindings, and any field you use from the template or annotate for Angular should be public

### Testing

For unit tests, use `npm run test` for continuous testing in watch mode and use
`npm run test:once` for single test. To view code coverage after running test, open `coverage/html/index.html` in your browser.

For e2e tests, use `npm run e2e`. To run unit test and e2e test at the same time, use `npm run ci`.
