```

## Features
* Webpack 2

Default dev port is `3000`.

Default production port is `8088`.

These can be changed in constants.js

The scripts are set to compile css next to scss because ngc compiler does not support Sass.
To compile scss, use `npm run sass`, but many of the scripts will either build or watch scss files.

Use `npm start` for dev server;

Use `npm run server:prod` for production server and production watch.

Use `npm run prod:build` for production build.

To create AOT version, run `npm run compile`. This will compile and build script.
Then you can use `npm run prodserver` to see to serve files.
Do not use build:aot directly unless you have already compiled.
Use `npm run compile` instead, it compiles and builds:aot
